  <div id="recipeSteps">
   ## Steps:
   <ol id="stepList">
    <li>
     A JFrame, JPanel, and two JButtons have already been created. You set the text of both buttons to "Click Me". When you pack the JFrame and run the program, it should look like this:
     <img src="./sameSizeButtons.png"/>
    </li>
    <li>
     Add this ActionListener to both buttons. Then modify the actionPerformed() method to make the buttons change their text and size when the user clicks (follow instructions in the code).
    </li>
   </ol>
  </div>
