<div id="recipeGoal">
## Goal:


We are going to use GUI components to make a quiz in which only part of an image is displayed (like the one shown above). The player has to guess the name of each celebrity shown.

<div id="recipeSteps">
## Steps:

<ol id="stepList">
<li>The program already contains a JFrame and JPanel. There is also a selection of celebrity photos which you can use for the quiz (or replace them with your own selection).</li>
<li>Your challenge is to resize the frame so that only part of the celebrity's face is shown. </li>
<li>Ask the user to guess who each person is and keep a score of how many they get correct.

<li>End the program when there are no more images to display.</li>
</li></ol>
