        # Venn Diagram of Me


        <hr/>

        <img alt="Venn Diagram of me image" src="./images/vennDiagram.png"/>


        ## Goal:


        Use the RGB color model to create a Venn Diagram that showcases your personality.


        ## Steps:


        1. Find the Venn Diagram recipe program ( VennDiagram.pde ) and open it using
        Processing.

        2. Run the program and you should see an empty gray window.

        3. After the size() command, add code to draw 3 circles to form a Venn Diagram
        (see picture).

        The command to draw a circle in Processing is:

        ```

        ellipse (centerX, centerY, circleWidth, circleHeight);

        ```

        Change the x and y of each ellipse until they overlap as in the picture.


        Run the program. It should look a bit like this

        Now to add the colors. Processing uses the following command to draw in color:

        ```

        fill(red, green, blue, opacity);

        ```


        where red, green, blue, and opacity are all numbers between 0 and 255. So
        to make see-through red circles, we add the following line of code BEFORE
        we draw the circles.

        ```

        fill(255, 0, 0, 100);

        ```


        Run the program. It should look a bit like this We can now see the edges of
        all the circles because we made them "see-through" by setting the opacity
        to 100 (which is < 255)

        Add more fill commands (you will have to figure out where to put them) so
        that each ellipse has its own unique color.

        Label each of the circles with an aspect of your personality. Processing uses
        the following command to draw text. You will need to put numbers in place
        of xLocation, and yLocation. Play around with the x and y until it works with
        your diagram.

        ```

        text("TEXT", xLocation, yLocation);

        ```


        You can also make the text larger by changing the sizeOfLetters (you will
        have to figure out where to put this)

        ```

        textSize(sizeOfLetters);

        ```

        4. Change the x and y of each ellipse until they overlap as in the picture.

        5. Run the program. It should look a bit like this

        6. Now to add the colors. Processing uses the following command to draw in
        color:

        ```

        fill(red, green, blue, opacity);

        ```


        where red, green, blue, and opacity are all numbers between 0 and 255. So
        to make see-through red circles, we add the following line of code BEFORE
        we draw the circles.

        ```

        fill(255, 0, 0, 100);

        ```


        Run the program. It should look a bit like this We can now see the edges of
        all the circles because we made them "see-through" by setting the opacity
        to 100 (which is < 255)

        Add more fill commands (you will have to figure out where to put them) so
        that each ellipse has its own unique color.

        Label each of the circles with an aspect of your personality. Processing uses
        the following command to draw text. You will need to put numbers in place
        of xLocation, and yLocation. Play around with the x and y until it works with
        your diagram.

        ```

        text("TEXT", xLocation, yLocation);

        ```


        You can also make the text larger by changing the sizeOfLetters (you will
        have to figure out where to put this)

        ```

        textSize(sizeOfLetters);

        ```

        7. Run the program. It should look a bit like this We can now see the edges
        of all the circles because we made them "see-through" by setting the opacity
        to 100 (which is < 255)

        8. Add more fill commands (you will have to figure out where to put them)
        so that each ellipse has its own unique color.

        9. Label each of the circles with an aspect of your personality. Processing

        ```

        10. You can also make the text larger by changing the sizeOfLetters (you will
        have to figure out where to put this)

        ```

        textSize(sizeOfLetters);

        ## Goal:


        You are going to make a face with animated eyes. You could use your own face
        (if you have a photo) or a zombie, a cat, or whatever you like. Whatever you
        choose, the eyes should be prominent (large).


        ## Steps:


        1. Find the Zombie Eyes recipe program ( zombie_eyes.pde ) and open it using
        Processing.

        2. Drop the image of a face onto your sketch. Load it like this in the setup
        method:

        ```


        PImage face = loadImage("face.jpeg");

        ```

        3. Adjust the size of your sketch if necessary.

        ```


        size(width, height);

        ```

        4. Adjust the size of your image so that the size matches the sketch and draw
        it using the image command.

        ```


        face.resize(width, height);

        image(face, 0, 0);

        ```

        5. Place 2 ellipses over the irises of the eyes in the draw method.

        ```


        ellipse(x, y, width, height);

        ```

        6. Give the irises a color with the fill command (use numbers in place of
        red, green, blue).

        ```


        fill(red, green, blue);

        ```

        7. Use mouseX and mouseY to change the color of the irises when the mouse
        moves.

        8. Draw black pupils on top of the irises.

        9. Make sure you SAVE YOUR CODE when you are done.

        ## Description


        <hr/>

        Print the words to the "99 bottles" song in a for loop.

        99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.

        Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

        98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.

        Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

        ...

        1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.

        Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

        No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.

        Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.


        ## Instructions


        <hr/>

        1. Find the 99 Bottles recipe program ( bottles.pde ) and open it using Processing.

        2. You can find help for printing the lyrics to this song [here](https://academickids.com/encyclopedia/index.php/99_Bottles_of_Beer).

        3. Do not repeat any of the lyrics in your code - use a for loop!

        4. Look out for the changes you will need to make to the lyrics when you get
        down to 1 or zero

        bottles.

      text: "\n\n# Introduction to Remainder\n\nThe remainder operator is represented\
        \ as the percent sign %. This just means the remainder after division. You\
        \ may also hear this be called modulo.\nA common use for remainder is to test\
        \ if a number is odd or even.\nTo do this test, you divide the number by 2.\n\
        If the remainder is zero, the number is even, but if the remainder is one,\
        \ the number is odd. In code this would look like this:\n```\nint number =\
        \ new Random().nextInt(100);\n if (number % 2 == 0) {\n     System.out.println(\"\
        number is even\");\n }\n else {\n     System.out.println(\"number is odd\"\
        );\n }\n```\nAnother use for remainder could be to track every 20 times a\
        \ loop is executed, as follows:\n```\nfor (int i=1; i<=1000; i++) {\n    //\
        \ do some code\n    if (i % 20 == 0){\n        System.out.println(\"20 more\

        ## Goal:


        Use a for loop and remainder (%) to build FizzBuzz - a children''s counting
        game.


        ## Steps:


        1. Write a loop to print all the numbers between 1 and 20.

        2. Now modify the  program so that any time a number is divisible by 3, print
        "fizz" in place of the number. And instead of printing numbers that are divisible
        by 5, print "buzz". For numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5, print
        "fizzbuzz".

        3. If your code is correct, the program will now print:


        1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz, 16,

        ## Goal:


        Tell the user their grade! Use double variables to allow for decimals,


        ## Steps:


        1. Write code to ask the user for their test score.


        Your program MUST allow the user to enter a test score that has a DECIMAL,
        e.g. 75.5

        2. Give them a different message according to their score.


        Example, for a good score: "Wow! You must have studied really hard for that
        test!"


        HINT: Think about how you would convert a String to an int and use SIMILAR
        code to convert their test score to a double.

        \ the mouse!\n\n## Steps:\n\n1. Find the Googly Eyes recipe program in Eclipse.\n\
        2. Find an image on the internet and copy it to the /images folder. It can\
        \ be anything as long as it has large eyes!\n3. On line 1 of your program\
        \ (outside of the methods) declare a variable for the image:\n```\n   PImage\
        \ face;\n```\n4. In your setup() method, import your image using the following\
        \ code:\n```\n\n    face = loadImage(\u201Cface.jpg\u201D);\n```\n5. If you\
        \ need to, change the code you just entered so that \"face.jpg\" matches the\
        \ name of your picture.\n6. Set the size of your window and the size of your\
        \ image to be the same by entering the following code in the setup method.\n\
        ```\n    size(800,600);\n    face.resize(width,height);\n```\n7. In the draw()\
        \ method, place a white ellipse over the left eye of your image.\nHINT: To\
        \ find out where to put it, add code to print the mouseX and mouseY where\
        \ you click the mouse.\n8. Now add a pupil (the black part) to the left eye\
        \ earlier.\n9. Use mouseX and mouseY to move the left pupil where the mouse\
        \ moves.\n10. Add a white ellipse over the right eye using the same technique\
        \ used for the left eye.\n11. Add a right pupil and make it move by using\
        \ mouseX + [distance from left eye] and mouseY + [distance from left eye].\n\
        12. Here\u2019s the tricky part: stop the pupils from going outside of the\
        \ white circles!  To do this, imagine a rectangle that the pupil should stay\
        \ within.  When mouseX and mouseY goes outside of these bounds, set it back\
        \ to the boundary.  Put this code before you draw the pupils.\n13. Make sure\
        \ you SAVE YOUR CODE when you are done.\n\n\n\n"

        charAt()length()


        ## Goal:


        Use charAt and length methods to access information in a String variable.


        ## Steps:


        1. Create a String variable and initialize it with some characters (at least
        3).

        2. Use the charAt method to print the 3rd character in the String (remember,
        computers start counting at zero).

        3. Use the length method to print how many characters are in the String.

        4. Use a for loop to examine each character in the String, and when you find
        one that matches the character you are looking for, print its index.

        ## Goal:


        Use charAt and length methods to access the digits of pi in a String variable.


        ## Steps:


        1. Place the first 20 digits of pi into a String variable.

        2. Print out the first 3 digits of pi. Remember the first digit will be pi.charAt(0).

        3. Use a for loop to print each digit of pi on a new line.

        4. If your computer can play sounds, use the speak method to say each digit
        of pi using a loop.

        5. [CHALLENGE]


        After printing the first 3 digits of pi, ask the user for the next digit using
        the getInputFromUser() method


        Compare the users'' char to the next digit of pi


        If they are correct, print out "correct". If they are not, print "incorrect"

        />\n\n## Goal:\n\nThe player of the game has to click the mouse where the\
        \ donkey's tail will go. The problem is, the picture keeps disappearing!\n\
        \n## Steps:\n\nThis recipe uses two bounding boxes. One is in the top left\
        \ corner of the sketch, the other is a target area where the donkey tail should\
        \ be pinned. In the recipe image, the bounding boxes are colored green to\
        \ help demonstrate the concept, but you won't see them when playing the actual\
        \ game.\n1. Find the Pin the Tail recipe program in Eclipse.\n2. Find a picture\
        \ of a donkey and a separate picture of a tail (tail needs a transparent background).\n\
        \nSave the images to your Desktop.\nDrag and drop each file onto your sketch.\n\
        3. Save the images to your Desktop.\n4. Drag and drop each file onto your\
        \ sketch.\n5. Load the pictures into variables as follows.\n\nFirst create\
        \ (declare) variables to hold the images at the top of the sketch.\n```\n\n\
        PImage donkey;\nPImage tail;\n```\n\nIn the setup() method, set the variables\
        \ to hold the images.\n```\n\ndonkey = loadImage(\"donkey.jpg\");      //change\
        \ the file name if you need to\ntail = loadImage(\"tail.png\");      //change\
        \ the file name if you need to\n```\n6. First create (declare) variables to\
        \ hold the images at the top of the sketch.\n```\n\nPImage donkey;\nPImage\
        \ tail;\n```\n7. In the setup() method, set the variables to hold the images.\n\
        ```\n\ndonkey = loadImage(\"donkey.jpg\");      //change the file name if\
        \ you need to\ntail = loadImage(\"tail.png\");      //change the file name\
        \ if you need to\n```\n8. In the setup() method, set your canvas size to EXACTLY\
        \ match the size of the donkey image. You can get the size of the image from\
        \ the file information on the Desktop.\n```\n\nsize(width, height);     //replace\
        \ width, height with your picture's dimensions\n```\n9. Draw the donkey and\
        \ tail in the draw() method. The tail should move around with the mouse. Try\
        \ it!\n```\n\nbackground (donkey);\nimage(tail, mouseX, mouseY);\n```\n10.\
        \ If you need to, resize the tail to fit onto the donkey. Since this is done\
        \ ONCE, put this code into the setup() method.\nNote: if you leave height\
        \ or width as zero, the image will scale proportionally.\n```\n\ntail.resize(width,\
        \ height);     //replace width, height with your tail's dimensions\n```\n\
        11. If the top of the tail is not in the top left corner of your image, you\
        \ will have to adjust the x and y values so that the top of the tail is drawn\
        \ where you click the mouse. To do this, you would need to adjust the x and\
        \ y values to make your image work as shown below.\n```\n\nimage(tail, mouseX-10,\
        \ mouseY-20);\n```\n12. Now we are going to start adding bounding boxes! These\
        \ should go in the draw() method, AFTER the background is drawn!\n\nFirst\
        \ draw a bounding box (rectangle) in the top left corner of the sketch.\n\
        ```\n\nrect(0, 0, 30, 30);\n```\n\nNow we need to draw another bounding box\
        \ where the tail should go. You can use mousePressed to help you figure out\
        \ the x and y coordinates of the corner of this rectangle (see the picture\
        \ at the top of this page for an idea of what this will look like). Example:\n\
        ```\n\nrect(454, 75, 40, 40);\n```\n13. First draw a bounding box (rectangle)\
        \ in the top left corner of the sketch.\n```\n\nrect(0, 0, 30, 30);\n```\n\
        14. Now we need to draw another bounding box where the tail should go. You\
        \ can use mousePressed to help you figure out the x and y coordinates of the\
        \ corner of this rectangle (see the picture at the top of this page for an\
        \ idea of what this will look like). Example:\n```\n\nrect(454, 75, 40, 40);\n\
        ```\n15. Now, change your code so the donkey is only shown when the mouse\
        \ is inside the corner bounding box. Hint: use the dist() command:\n```\n\n\
        dist(0, 0, mouseX, mouseY) < 30\n```\n\nWhen the mouse is outside the corner\
        \ box, you should show a solid color background.\n16. Now, adjust your code\
        \ so the tail sticks when you click the mouse (this means it will no longer\
        \ move when the mouse moves). Hint: you will need to save the x and y values\
        \ in variables at the top of your sketch.\n17. When the tail has been pinned,\
        \ write code to check if the tail was pinned inside the target bounding box.\
        \ You can use dist() like you did earlier, or you can write your own code\
        \ to check it another way. Show the donkey so the user knows where they pinned\
        \ the tail.\n18. If the tail is in the right place, the player wins and you\
        \ play a sound. To play a sound use the following code\n```\n\n    playWhoohoo()\n\
        ```\n19. When you have tested that your pogram works, remove the line of code\
        \ that draws the tail target bounding box and see if you can pin the tail\
        \ on the donkey.\n20. Make sure you SAVE YOUR CODE when you are done.\n21.\
        \ OPTION: Add some text to give the user instructions on how to play the game.\n\
        ```\n\ntextSize(24);\ntext(\"Message\",100,20);\n```\n\n\n\n"

        # Prime or Not


        <hr/>

        <img src="./images/prime.png"/>


        ## Goal:


        Ask the user for a number, then tell them if the number is prime!

        A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.


        ## Steps:


        1. Ask the user for a number (JOptionPane).

        2. Use a for loop, if statement, and modulo to find if the number is prime.

        3. If the number is divisible by any number other than 1 or itself, the number
        is not prime.

        <img src="./images/fibonacci.png"/>


        ## Goal:


        Print out the first 12 numbers of the fibonacci sequence.


        ## Steps:


        1. There is more than one way to code a solution to this. The following steps
        give you some guidelines for one of them.

        2. Declare and initialize three int variables: number1, number2, and sum.

        3. Initialize number1 and number2 to the first two numbers of the fibonacci
        sequence (0 and 1) and print both numbers.

        4. Use a for loop that calculates the sum of the two numbers and prints it.
        The for loop should repeat 10 times.

        5. Now try to figure out how to change the variables before the for loop repeats
        so the sequence of numbers is correct.

        GoOfY NaMeS


        ## Goal:


        Write an algorithm to change a String into a "goofy" version.


        ## Steps:


        1. Ask the user to enter their name.

        2. Use a loop to alternately modify each character of the name into uppercase
        and lowercase letters until a new "goofy" representation of their name has
        been constructed.


        For example, if they enter their name as Alexander Hamilton


        their goofy name will be AlExAnDeR HaMiLtOn

        3. Show the user the goofy version of their name in a pop-up.

        \ a master of utilizing for loops. Complete all the for loop challenges on\
        \ the paper. Please read each challenge carefully and make sure that your\
        \ for loops display exactly what is asked. If you finish them all, try the\
        \ bonus challenge.\n\n### Single For-Loops\n\nWrite a for loop to do each\
        \ the following:\n1. Display all numbers from 0 to 100\n2. Display all numbers\
        \ from 100 to 0\n3. Display all even numbers from 2 to 100\n4. Display all\
        \ odd numbers from 1 to 99\n5. Display all numbers from 1 to 500. If the number\
        \ is odd, print \u201Codd\u201D next to the number. If the number is even,\
        \ print \u201Ceven\u201D next to the number.\nEg:\n1 is odd\n2 is even\n3\
        \ is odd\n4 is even\n5 is odd...etc.\n6. Display all multiples of 7 from 0\
        \ to 777.\n7. Print all the years you were alive and how old you were in each.\
        \ e.g. \u201CIn 1979, i was 2 years old.\u201D (for a really old person)\n\
        \n### Nested For-Loops\n\nWrite nested for loops (a for loop inside another\
        \ for loop) to do the following:\n\n1. Display this output:\n0  0\n0  1\n\
        0  2\n1  0\n1  1\n1  2\n2  0\n2  1\n2  2\n2. Display the numbers 1 through\
        \ 9 in a 3x3 square grid like this:\n1  2  3\n4  5  6\n7  8  9\n3. Display\
        \ the numbers 1 through 100 in a 10x10 square grid.\n4. Display the following\
        \ output:\n*\n*  *\n*  *  *\n*  *  *  *\n*  *  *  *  *\n*  *  *  *  *  *\n\
        \n### **Bonus**\n\nWrite a for loop that counts down from 100 to 0. However,\
        \ the for loop must start with for(int i = 0;  and you may NOT have any code\
        \ ABOVE your for loop.\n\n"

        Make an obedient robot that will obey commands to draw shapes.


        ## Steps:


        1. This recipe practices writing and calling void methods.

        2. Make a new class, create a main method, and show the robot.

        3. Have the robot draw a square.

        4. Put this code into a drawSquare() method.

        5. Have the robot draw a triangle.

        6. Put this code into a drawTriangle() method.

        7. Have the robot draw a circle.

        8. Put this code into a drawCircle() method.

        9. Ask the user which shape they want. Draw the appropriate shape depending
        on their answer (call the right method).

        10. Ask the user which color they want. Give them some choices so you don''t
        have to accomodate every possible color. Color the the shape depending on
        their answer.

        ## Steps:


        1. Ask the user to enter the type of pet they want (give them a few choices).

        2. Use a loop (maybe a while loop?) to keep offering interactions with their
        pet until the desired pet happiness level has been reached. Examples of activities
        are:   Feed, Walk, Play

        3. Write a method for each of the pet activities offered. Each activity should
        increase (or decrease) the pet''s happiness level by a different amount, depending
        on the kind of pet they have. For example, a fish might not enjoy a walk!

      text: "\n\n# Level 0 Study Guide\n\n\n###\n\nVariables\n\u2018Declare and initialize\
        \ a variable\u2019 means make a variable and give it a value.\nint age = 12;\n\
        String name = \u201CSarah\u201D;\nRemember, String is capitalized and the\
        \ value always has quotes around it.\nEvery time you want to hold a new piece\
        \ of information you need to declare the variable and initialize it, by setting\
        \ it equal to something.\nIf you want to generate a random number you do it\
        \ like this.\nint x = new Random().nextInt(10);\nThe number in parenthesis\
        \ limits the value of the random number you will get. In this case, x will\
        \ be a number between 0 and 9.\n\n###\n\nif Statements\nif (condition){\n\n\
        }\nelse if (next condition){\n\n}\nelse{\n\n}\nThe question looks like this\
        \ for a String\n(name .equals (\u201CSarah\u201D))\nYou use .equals to compare\
        \ a String. The String value is in parenthesis and in quotes.\nThe question\
        \ looks like this for an int\n(age == 12)\nRemember you use == for a comparison.\n\
        It is a good idea to use an else with an if statement to catch any options\
        \ you didn\u2019t think of.\n\n###\n\nfor loop\nfor ( int i = 0; i<10; i++){\n\
        \n}\n<font color=\"green\">\nint i = 0;\n</font>\nThis is the starting point\
        \ of the loop. You must declare the int.\n<font color=\"green\">\ni<10;\n\
        </font>\nThis is the finishing point for the loop. The loop will continue\
        \ as long as i is less than 10.\ni++ This is how much the loop counter changes\
        \ by each time. In this case it increments (goes up) by 1.\nfor ( int i =\
        \ 10; i>0; i-=2){\n\n}\nThis loop counts down in 2s starting at 10.\n10, 8\
        \ , 6, 4, 2.  It doesn\u2019t go to 0 because it must be greater than 0.\n\
        Notice that you have to change from less than (<) to greater than (>) when\
        \ you count down.\n\n###\n\nJOptionPane\nIf you want a pop up to give the\
        \ user a message use\nJOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, \u201CHello \u201D\
        + name);\nDon\u2019t forget the\n<b>\nnull\n</b>\n, or that any text needs\
        \ to be in quotes.\nIf you want to get an answer from the user, use:\nString\
        \ ageString = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(\u201CHow old are you?\u201D);\n\
        Remember you must catch the user\u2019s answer in a String, otherwise you\
        \ can\u2019t use it.\nBecause the answer is always a String, you sometimes\
        \ want to convert it to a number so you can do a calculation. This is how\
        \ you do it.\nint age = Integer.parseInt(ageString);\nIf you want to write\
        \ something to the console, instead of using a pop-up\nSystem.out.println(age);\n\
        \n### Methods\n\nYou must have a\n<b>\nmain method\n</b>\nin order to start\
        \ your class running.\npublic static void main(String[] args){\n\n}\nOther\
        \ methods looks like this\nvoid drawSquare(){\nfor (int i= 0; i<4; i++){\n\
        Tortoise.move(100);\nTortoise.turn(90);\n}\n}\n<font color=\"green\">\nvoid\n\
        </font>\nThis tells you what the method will return - in this case nothing.\n\
        <font color=\"green\">\ndrawSquare\n</font>\nThis is the name of the method,\
        \ that you use to call it.\n<font color=\"green\">\n(  )\n</font>\nThis tells\
        \ you what parameters the method needs. In this case it doesn\u2019t need\
        \ any.\nYou call the method like this:\ndrawSquare();\nLook at this method:\n\
        int sevenTimes(int number){\nreturn number * 7;\n}\n<font color=\"green\"\
        >\nint\n</font>\nThis method is going to a return an int so you need to create\
        \ an int variable to store it. In the example below, the variable is named\
        \ \"answer\".\n<font color=\"green\">\nsevenTimes\n</font>\nThis is the name\
        \ of the method, that you use when you call it.\n<font color=\"green\">\n\
        (int number)\n</font>\nThis tells you what parameters the method needs. In\
        \ this case it needs you to give an int. In the example below, the int is\
        \ the number 2.\nint answer = sevenTimes(2);\nThe value of answer will be\
        \ 14.\n\n###\n\nModulo\n\nModulo means remainder.\nThe value of 11%5 is 1,\
        \ because 5 goes into 11, 2 times (5x2=10) with a remainder of 1.\n\nIt is\
        \ useful to use modulo to alternate between options. e.g.\n\nfor (int i =\
        \ 0; i<1000;i+=10){\nif (i%3==0){\nfill(255,0,0);\n}\nelse if (i%3==1){\n\
        fill(0,255,0);\n}\nelse if (i%3==2){\nfill(0,0,255);\n}\nellipse(i,i,10,10);\n\
        }\n\nThis code will draw a line of circles alternating in red, green and blue.\n\

        \ for the ball to go through. The gap between the pipes will not change.\n\
        13. Make a second pipe that will go down to the bottom of the sketch, leaving\
        \ a space between the two pipes that is the size of the gap (see step 12).\

        # My First Swing GUI


        <hr/>

        <img src="./images/myFirstSwingGui.png"/>


        ## Goal:


        We are going to make a simple GUI (pronounced gooey). GUI stands for Graphical
        User Interface, which in this case means a window and everything that is drawn
        on it. The user will see a window (frame) with a greeting and image similar
        to the one shown above.


        ## Steps:


        1. Create a JFrame. A JFrame is a window that has a border and title. It will
        contain one component of your GUI. In this program, it will contain a JPanel
        (see next). JFrames are invisible when you create them, so you will need to
        make it visible (follow instructions in the code).

        2. Create a JPanel and add it to the JFrame. A JPanel is a simple container
        that provides space for your program to add more components. In this program,
        it will contain a JLabel (see next).

        3. Create a JLabel and add it to the JPanel. A JLabel allows you to display
        small amounts of text, and/or an image. In this program, both will be displayed
        (follow instructions in the code).

        4. Packing a JFrame causes it to resize itself so that the its components
        are visible. If you do anything to change the size of its contents, a JFrame
        should be packed again.

        ## Goal:


        We are going to use GUI components to make quiz that shows images to the player
        and asks them questions relating to the images they see.


        ## Steps:


        1. Create a JFrame. A JFrame is a window that has a border and title. JFrames
        are invisible when you create them, so you will need to make it visible (follow
        instructions in the code).

        2. Create a Component. Call the method provided, to put an image (icon) into
        the Component (follow instructions in the code).

        3. Add the Component to the JFrame (follow instructions in the code).

        4. Packing a JFrame causes it to resize itself so that its components are
        visible. If you do anything to change the size of its contents, a JFrame should
        be packed again.

        5. Use a pop-up to ask the user a question relating to the image and tell
        them if they get the right answer.

        6. Replace the Component with another that has a different image and ask a
        new question (follow instructions in the code).

        ## Goal:


        We are going to use GUI components to make drum kit. When different images
        of the drum kit are clicked, they will play appropriate sounds.


        ## Steps:


        1. Create a JFrame. A JFrame is a window that has a border and title. It will

        the code) and add it to the JPanel.



        Packing a JFrame causes it to resize itself so that its components are visible.
        If you do anything to change the size of its contents, a JFrame should be
        packed again.

        When you run the program you should see the drum

        6. Add a MouseListener to the JLabel and complete the mouseClicked() method
        so that a drum sound is played when the drum image is clicked (follow instructions
        in the code).

        7. Repeat the above steps for a second JLabel that shows the image of a cymbal
        (follow instructions in the code).

        ## Goal:


        We are going to use GUI components to make a quiz in which only part of an
        image is displayed (like the one shown above). The player has to guess the
        name of each celebrity shown.


        ## Steps:


        1. The program already contains a JFrame and JPanel. There is also a selection
        of celebrity photos which you can use for the quiz (or replace them with your
        own selection).

        2. Your challenge is to resize the frame so that only part of the celebrity''s
        face is shown.

        3. Ask the user to guess who each person is and keep a score of how many they
        get correct.


        End the program when there are no more images to display.

        4. End the program when there are no more images to display.

        in a duel for the uer''s attention. When the user clicks on one button, the
        other button will demand to be clicked on!


        ## Steps:


        1. A JFrame, JPanel, and two JButtons have already been created. You set the
        text of both buttons to "Click Me". When you pack the JFrame and run the program,
        it should look like this:

        2. Add this ActionListener to both buttons. Then modify the actionPerformed()
        method to make the buttons change their text and size when the user clicks
        (follow instructions in the code).

        new FortuneCookie().showButton();\n}\n}\n\n3. Now change the showButton()\
        \ method in Step 1, to make a JFrame and get it to show up when you run the\
        \ program. Hint:\nframe.setVisible(true);\n\n4. Make a JButton and add it\
        \ to the JFrame.\nJButton button = new JButton();\nframe.add(button);\nframe.pack();\n\
        \n5. The next 4 steps make a pop-up appear that says, \u201CWoohoo\u201D when\

        # Jack-in-the-Box


        1. Create a user interface (GUI) that has a single button labeled "Surprise".

        If you need help, take a look at the instructions for the Fortune Cookie recipe.

        2. When the user presses the button 5 times, show them a jack-in-the-box using
        the methods below.

        (A sample jackInTheBox.png file is provided in the default package)

        private void showPicture(String fileName) {

        try {


        JLabel imageLabel = createLabelImage(fileName);

        JFrame frame = new JFrame();

        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

        frame.add(imageLabel);

        frame.setVisible(true);

        frame.pack();

        } catch (Exception e) {

        e.printStackTrace();

        }

        }

        private JLabel createLabelImage(String fileName) {

        try {

        URL imageURL = getClass().getResource(fileName);

        if (imageURL == null) {

        System.err.println("Could not find image " + fileName);

        return new JLabel();

        } else {

        Icon icon = new ImageIcon(imageURL);

        JLabel imageLabel = new JLabel(icon);

        return imageLabel;

        }

        } catch (Exception e) {

        System.err.println("Could not find image " + fileName);

        return new JLabel();

        }

        }

        3. Also play a sound when the jack-in-the-box pops up using this method.

        (A sample sound homer-woohoo.wav is provided in the default package)


        private void playSound(String soundFile) {

        try {

        AudioClip sound = JApplet.newAudioClip(getClass().getResource(soundFile));

        sound.play();

        } catch (Exception e) {

        e.printStackTrace();

        }

        1. Make a user interface with 3 buttons that will play different videos depending
        on which button is clicked.


        If you need help, take a look at the instructions for the Fortune Cookie recipe.

        # Vault


        A vault stands in the way of your progress. We need a secret agent to find
        the code to get through.

        1. You have been given a Vault class that describes how the vault will work.
        It has a secret code that will be randomly chosen each time the program is
        run.

        It also contains a tryCode() method that takes a number as a parameter and
        returns true if that number opens the vault, false otherwise.


        2. Create a Runner class with a main method. Create a vault object and call
        the tryCode() method. Print out the answer to see if you successfully opened
        the vault.


        3. Make a SecretAgent class that has a method findCode() that takes a Vault
        as a parameter.

        The codes are between 0 and 1 million. This method will try all the codes,
        and return the first code that opens the vault, or -1 if no code opened the
        vault.


        4. Add the SecretAgent object to main. Use a syso to print the result from
        findCode()

        # Introduction to Objects


        <img src="./images/duck.png" style="width: 400px; height: 190px;"/>

        1. Create a Duck class in your java project. Add its member variables and
        methods to match the picture above. Now add the code for the constructor of
        the Duck class:

        Duck(String favoriteFood, int numberOfFriends) {

        this.favoriteFood = favoriteFood;

        this.numberOfFriends = numberOfFriends;

        }

        2. Now pick your favorite animal and describe it with at least 2 member variables
        and 2 methods.


        3. Create a java class for your animal including:

        member variables

        methods(with sysouts)

        a constructor that sets the member variables


        4. Create a new java class. This will be a "runner" or "driver" class, so
        it will need a main method.


        5. In your runner class, create a Duck object (instance) by calling its constructor
        as follows:

        Duck daffy = new Duck("donuts",5);

        Now you have a duck object, you can make it quack:

        daffy.quack();

        6. Now create an instance of your animal (Hint: see step 5 above) and call
        its methods.

        Hint: make variables for the bird's X and Y position and use them for the\
        \ ellipse in the draw method.\n5. Add velocity to the bird.\nHint: make a\

        \ its value should change the velocity of your bird.\nint birdYVelocity =\
        \ -10;\n6.  Give the bird gravity.\nHint: make a variable for the gravity\

        \ birdYVelocity.\nint gravity = 1;\n7. Make the bird jump (flap) when the\
        \ mouse is clicked.\nHint: construct a mousePressed() method the same way\
        \ setup() and draw() were made.\nIn this method, reset the bird\u2019s velocity\

        \ sketch.\n\nIn the draw() method:\nfill(red, green, blue);\nrect(x, y, width,\
        \ height);\n9. Make the pipe move from right to left.\n\nHint: make a variable\
        \ for the pipe X position and change it in the draw method.\n10. Make the\
        \ pipe teleport back to the right side of the screen once it has passed through\
        \ the left. This will simulate the repeating pipes coming from the right of\
        \ the screen.\nTip: Put this code into a teleportPipes() method and you can\
        \ also call it from the setup() method to create the first pipes.\n11. Set\
        \ the upper pipe's height to a new random number each time it teleports\n\
        int upperPipeHeight = (int) random(100, 400);\n12. Create a variable, pipeGap,\
        \ to represent the gap between the pipes. Make sure the gap is big enough\
        \ for the ball to go through. The gap between the pipes will not change.\n\
        13. Make a second pipe that will go down to the bottom of the sketch, leaving\
        \ a space between the two pipes that is the size of the gap (see step 12).\
        \ Make sure both pipes use the same value for their x position. Set the lower\
        \ pipe y value by adding the upper pipe height and pipe gap. Ex:\nlowerY =\
        \ upperPipeHeight + pipeGap;\n14. Make the game end when the bird hits the\
        \ pipe. Figure it out by yourself, or use this method:\n```\nboolean intersectsPipes()\
        \ { \n         if (birdY < upperPipeHeight && birdX > pipeX && birdX < (pipeX+pipeWidth)){\n\
        \            return true; }\n        else if (birdY>lowerPipeTop && birdX\
        \ > pipeX && birdX < (pipeX+pipeWidth)) {\n            return true; }\n  \
        \      else { return false; }\n}\n```\n15. End the game when the bird hits\
        \ the ground.\nMake a rectangle for the ground.\nUse a boolean variable at\
        \ the top of the sketch to indicate if game has ended.\n17.  Create a score\
        \ and make it increase each time the bird passes through a pipe.\ntext(text,\
        \ xPosition, yPosition);\n18. OPTIONAL.   Use images for the background, pipes\
        \ and bird (see image at top). You can find your own images, or those provided\
        \ in the Module 3 Java project. See below for code snippets to load and draw\
        \ images.\n\nPImage back;\nPImage pipeBottom;\nPImage pipeTop;\nPImage bird;\n\
        void setup() {\nback = loadImage(\"flappyBackground.jpg\");\npipeBottom =\

        \ see if your code is working correctly. Instead of asking a person to run\
        \ the program each time it is changed to make sure it still runs properly,\
        \ we can make much more reliable automated tests to check it out. These are\
        \ known as unit tests.\nTest-driven development (TDD) is a way of developing\
        \ code where you write the tests before you even start writing the program.\
        \  It\u2019s a way to think through what your code must be able to do before\
        \ your write it.\n\n### JUnit Tests\n\nJUnit is an open source framework designed\
        \ for the purpose of writing and running tests for java programs.\n\nTests\
        \ can be written that specify the expected return value from running some\
        \ code.\nThe syntax for the tests looks like this:\nassertEquals(expected,\
        \ actual)\nIf the \"expected\" value matches the \"actual\" value, the results\
        \ bar displayed after running the tests will be green. If they are different\
        \ (or there are errors), the results bar will be red.\n\nFor example, in the\
        \ context of the \"real world\"\nassertEquals(true, Is water wet?)       results\
        \ bar will be green\n\nassertEquals(true, Are zombies  real?)       results\
        \ bar will be red\n\nassertEquals(false, Is coding lame?)       results bar\
        \ will be green\nNow for some real code. Will the results bar be green or\
        \ red for these asserts?\nassertEquals(4, add(2,2));\n\nassertEquals(\u201C\
        brains\u201D, getZombieFood());\n\nassertEquals(2, getLargest(3,2));\n\n\n"

      text: "\n\n# Running Race - Explaining Static\n\nThe static keyword is a reserved\
        \ word in Java like int, for, if, and else.\nIt can be placed before the type\
        \ when declaring member variables:\n```\n\nstatic int var = 1;\nstatic Robot\
        \ rob;\n```\nand before the return type for method definitions:\n```\n\nstatic\
        \ float calculateArea(float width, float height){ // code }\npublic static\
        \ void main(String[] args){ // code }\n```\n\n### 1. Static Variable Lifetime\n\
        \nA member variable without static\n<b>\nDOES NOT\n</b>\nexist before an object/instance\
        \ of a class is made.\nA member variable with static\n<b>\nDOES\n</b>\nexist\
        \ before an object/instance of a class is made.\nTake the Athlete class for\
        \ example:\n```\n\npublic class Athlete {\n  static String raceLocation =\
        \ \"New York\";\n  static String raceStartTime = \"9.00am\";\n\n  String name;\n\
        \  int speed;\n  int bibNumber;\n  \n  Athlete (String name, int speed){\n\
        \      this.name = name;\n      this.speed = speed;\n  }\n\n  static double\
        \ calculateDuration(double startSec, double finishSec){ // code }\n\n  void\
        \ run(){ // code }\n}\n```\nThe static member variables in the Athlete class\
        \ can be a accessed and modified without an object/instance of Athlete.\n\
        This does not work for non-static member variables:\n```\n\nAthlete.raceLocation\
        \ = \"NYC\";           // OK!\nAthlete.name = \"Jim\";                   //\
        \ ERROR!\n\nAthlete jim = new Athlete(\"Jim\", 10);   // Athlete object/instance\
        \ jim\n\njim.raceLocation = \"Boston\";            // OK!\njim.name = \"Jimmy\"\
        \                      // OK!\n```\n\n### 2. Only 1 Static Variable for all\
        \ Objects of a Class\n\nThere is only 1 static member variable for all objects\
        \ of a class.\nThere are unique variables for each object of a class. For\
        \ example:\n```\n\nAthlete jim = new Athlete(\"Jim\", 10);\nAthlete amy =\
        \ new Athlete(\"Amy\", 6);\n\nSystem.out.println(jim.name);           // prints\
        \ \"Jim\"\nSystem.out.println(amy.name);           // prints \"Amy\"\nSystem.out.println(jim.raceStartTime);\
        \  // prints \"9.00am\"\nSystem.out.println(amy.raceStartTime);  // prints\
        \ \"9.00am\"\n```\nIn this example changing raceStartTime for jim to \"10.00am\"\
        \ also changes the raceStartTime for amy.\nThe raceStartTime variable is the\
        \ same for both jim and amy.\n\n### 3. Non-Static Member Variables and Methods\
        \ can not be put inside Static Methods\n\nstatic methods can also be called\
        \ before an object of a class exists, while non-static methods can't:\n```\n\
        \nAthlete.calculateDuration(0.0, 14.7);   // OK!\nAthlete.run();         \
        \                 // ERROR!\nAthlete jim = new Athlete(\"Jim\", 10);\njim.run();\
        \                              // OK!\njim.calculateDuration(0.0, 14.7); \
        \      // OK!\n```\nThis is why non-static member variables and methods can't\
        \ be placed inside of static methods.\nStatic methods can be called before\
        \ an object is created when non-static member variables haven't been created\
        \ yet!\n```\n\nstatic double calculateDuration(double startSec, double finishSec){\n\
        \    double durationSec = finishSec - startSec;\n    \n    System.out.println(name\
        \ + \" ran the race in \" + durationSec + \" seconds.\"); // ERROR! name is\
        \ non-static\n    return durationSec;\n}\n```\nThe\n<b>\nthis\n</b>\nkeyword\
        \ refers to an object so it can't be put inside of a static method either:\n\
        ```\n\npublic static void main(String[] args){\n    JFrame frame = new JFrame();\n\
        \    frame.addActionListener(this);      // ERROR!\n}\n```\n\n\n"

        # Netflix


        1. The default package contains code for Movie and NetflixQueue classes.


        2. Create your own class with a main() method that will use Movie and NetflixQueue
        to complete the following challenges:


        1. Instantiate some Movie objects (at least 5).

        2. Use the Movie class to get the ticket price of one of your movies.


        3. Instantiate a NetflixQueue.

        4. Add your movies to the Netflix queue.

        5. Print all the movies in your queue.


        6. Use your NetflixQueue object to finish the sentence "the best movie is...."

        7. Use your NetflixQueue to finish the sentence "the second best movie is...."

        \ height);\nIn the draw method, set the background color of your sketch\n\
        background(red,green,blue);\n3. In the draw method, draw a frog on the bottom\
        \ of the canvas. (It can be a ball for now)\nfill(red, green, blue);\nellipse(x,\
        \ y, width, height);\n4. Make member variables to keep track of your frog\u2019\
        s hop distance, x and y position\n5. Add code to the method below (match the\
        \ code to the comments) to give our frog movement.\n```\nvoid keyPressed()\n\
        {\n    if(key == CODED){\n        if(keyCode == UP)\n        {\n         \
        \   //Frog Y position goes up\n        }\n        else if(keyCode == DOWN)\n\
        \        {\n            //Frog Y position goes down \n        }\n        else\
        \ if(keyCode == RIGHT)\n        {\n            //Frog X position goes right\n\

        \ X position goes left\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n6. Write a method to keep\
        \ our frog from going outside of the canvas\n7. Create a new Car class in\
        \ Eclipse. Your Car class will include the car\u2019s x position, y position,\
        \ the size of the car, and the speed of the car.\n8. Create a constructor\
        \ for your Car class that initializes each member variable with parameters.\n\
        9. Copy this functionality into your Car class to display your car\n```\n\
        void display()\n  {\n    fill(0,255,0);\n    rect(x , y,  size, 50);\n  }\n\
        ```\n10. Declare several Car member variables inside your class and initialize\
        \ them in the setup method.\n11. Call the display() method from your draw\
        \ method for each car. You should see your cars appear.\n12. Inside your Car\
        \ class write a method for the car to move to the left with its speed.\n13.\
        \ Inside your Car class write a method for the car to move to the left with\
        \ its speed. In the same method, if the car goes off the canvas, have it return\
        \ to the rightmost position of your canvas.  (hint: use Processing's width\
        \ variable)\n14.  Write another method for the car to move to the right with\
        \ its speed. In the same method,  if the car goes off the canvas, have it\
        \ return to the leftmost position of your canvas\n15.  In the draw() method,\
        \ alternate the driving direction of each of your cars to either go left or\
        \ right. Use the display() method after every drive method.\n16. Create getX(),\
        \ getY(), and getSize() methods in your Car class.\n17. Check when a car hits\
        \ your frog. You can use the following intersection method to help.\n```\n\
        boolean intersects(Car car) {\n if ((frogY > car.getY() && frogY < car.getY()+50)\
        \ &&\n                (frogX > car.getX() && frogX < car.getX()+car.getSize()))\
        \ {\n   return true;\n  }\n else  {\n  return false;\n }\n```\n18. Call the\
        \ intersects method for one of your cars in your draw method.  If the intersects\
        \ method returns true, return your frog to the starting point.\n19. Repeat\
        \ step 18 for all of your cars.\n20. OPTIONAL.   Use images for the background,\
        \ cars and frog (see image at top). You can find your own images, or those\
        \ provided in the Module 3 Java project. See below for code snippets to load\
        \ and draw images.\n```\n\n PImage back;\n PImage carLeft;\n PImage carRight;\n\
        \ PImage frog;\n    void settings(){\n        size(844,600);\n    }\n    void\

        We are going to make a translator (similar to Google translate) that converts
        English to Pig Latin.

        1. Make a UI that looks something like this:


        2. Using the PigLatinTranslator class in the package, create a program that:

        * Translates a word in English to Pig Latin when a button is pressed.

        * Translates a word in Pig Latin to English when a button is pressed.

        * Make the computer speak the Pig Latin phrase (using Sound.speak(words))
        when a button is pressed.

        # Slot Machine


        We are going to make a slot machine.

        The slot machine we are going to make, will look a little like the middle
        row on this image:

        First, find 3 images for the slot machine to display, e.g. cherry, orange,
        lime.


        Each "reel" of the slot machine will randomly display one of 3 images you
        have chosen (you can add more images later if there is time).


        Put a "SPIN" button onto the frame that causes each of the 3 "reels" to randomly
        change the image they are showing.


        If all 3 reels have the same image showing (like in the picture above), the
        player wins. Display a "YOU WIN" message, optionally add a sound of success,
        and if you are still having fun - update a win counter to show the user how
        many times they have won.


        You may find the code below helpful:


        private JLabel createLabelImage(String fileName) throws MalformedURLException{

        URL imageURL = getClass().getResource(fileName);

        if (imageURL == null){

        System.err.println("Could not find image " + fileName);

        return new JLabel();

        }

        Icon icon = new ImageIcon(imageURL);

        JLabel imageLabel = new JLabel(icon);

        return imageLabel;

        # JUnit Tests


        When you have written a new program, you need to test if it is working properly.
        Also, if you need to make changes to an existing program, you need to make
        sure you haven''t broken anything that worked before.

        When you develop new code, you sometimes add print statements to check what
        is happening, but after you have done that, you need to go back and remove
        the print statements and you might break something in the process. So how
        can you test a program without changing its code?

        JUnit provides us with a framework to test code "from the outside".

        For example, The code below runs the static method add() on the Algorithms
        class. This test is not part of the Algorithms class, but an external testing
        class, and checks that when given the numbers 3 and 1, the add method returns
        the number 4.

        @Test

        public void testAdd() {

        assertEquals(4, Algorithms.add(3,1));

        }

        If a programmer later changes other parts of the Algorithms class for any
        reason, they can re-run this test to see if the add() method still works correctly.

        You can use a variety of assertions that allow the program to test for different
        conditions. In the above example, the code is testing for the equals condition.  Ask
        your teacher, or search the Internet for a complete overview of the JUnit
        class and its capabilities.

        int age = 12;\nString name = \u201CSarah\u201D;\nHowever, what if a program\
        \ needed a list of names? We don't want to declare multiple variables with\
        \ meaningless names like name1, name2, name3, etc.\nArrays allow us to store\
        \ multiple values of the same type. E.g.\nString[] names = {\"Sarah\", \"\
        Joe\",\"Ali\", \"Jose\"};\nString[] moreNames = new String[4];\nUnfortunately,\
        \ we need to know exactly how many elements we are going to get before we\
        \ can declare the array, which limits their use in our programs.\n\nThis is\
        \ where ArrayList comes in handy.\n\nArrayLists grow and shrink according\
        \ to how many elements are currently stored in them, i.e. they are \"dynamic\"\
        . In addition, you can add a mixture of object types in a single ArrayList.\n\
        ArrayList namesList = new ArrayList();\nnamesList.add(\"Sarah\");\nnamesList.add(10);\n\

        ###


        The end goal of this program is to use a depth first search algorithm to generate
        a random maze of any size.

        <img height="300" src="https://github.com/League-level4/League-level4.github.io/blob/master/maze_complete.png?raw=true"
        width="300"/>


        ###


        First, complete the Maze class.


        ####


        The result of running the program now gives us only a grid.

        <img height="300" src="https://github.com/League-level4/League-level4.github.io/blob/master/maze_incomplete.png?raw=true"
        width="300"/>


        ####


        In the MazeMaker class, complete the generateMaze method, selectNextPath method,
        the removeWalls method, and the getUnvisitedNeighbors method to generate a
        random maze.


        #####


        getUnvisitedNeighbors takes in a cell. It returns all the neighbors of the
        cell who have NOT yet been visited as an ArrayList.

        removeWalls takes in two cells. It then figures out the relationship between
        the two cells and sets their shared walls to false. For example, If cell1
        is directly above cell2, the removeWalls will set cell1''s south wall to false
        and set cell2''s north wall to false.

        selectNextPath is a recursive method that uses the depth first search alogorithm
        to determine which walls to remove.

        generateMaze will create a maze with the given dimensions, select a cell at
        random, and call the selectNextPath method using that random cell.


        ####


        When the maze maker is generating correct mazes, pick a random cell along
        the border and remove its exterior wall. This will be the starting point.
        Then select a random cell along the opposite wall and remove its exterior
        wall. This will be the finish line.

        ###


        The end goal of this program is to use a depth first search algorithm to generate
        a random maze of any size.

        <img height="300" src="https://github.com/League-level4/League-level4.github.io/blob/master/maze_complete.png?raw=true"
        width="300"/>


        ###


        First, complete the Maze class.


        ####


        The result of running the program now gives us only a grid.

        <img height="300" src="https://github.com/League-level4/League-level4.github.io/blob/master/maze_incomplete.png?raw=true"
        width="300"/>


        ####


        In the MazeMaker class, complete the generateMaze method, selectNextPath method,
        the removeWalls method, and the getUnvisitedNeighbors method to generate a
        random maze.


        #####


        getUnvisitedNeighbors takes in a cell. It returns all the neighbors of the
        cell who have NOT yet been visited as an ArrayList.

        removeWalls takes in two cells. It then figures out the relationship between
        the two cells and sets their shared walls to false. For example, If cell1
        is directly above cell2, the removeWalls will set cell1''s south wall to false
        and set cell2''s north wall to false.

        selectNextPath is a recursive method that uses the depth first search alogorithm
        to determine which walls to remove.

        generateMaze will create a maze with the given dimensions, select a cell at
        random, and call the selectNextPath method using that random cell.


        ####


        When the maze maker is generating correct mazes, pick a random cell along
        the border and remove its exterior wall. This will be the starting point.
        Then select a random cell along the opposite wall and remove its exterior
        wall. This will be the finish line.

        Modify the Pixel Art Maker program you created in Level 4.

        Add a save button that will save the state of the image. When the program
        is started,

        it should load the image from the file and display it on the grid.


        If you have not completed the Pixel Art Maker program, now would be a great
        time to do so.
